# On-the-l-Runyan-Poisson-Pearson-Method-to-Forecast-Football-Matches
Code developed by me for On the Élö–Runyan–Poisson–Pearson Method to Forecast Football Matches.

This code simulates soccer matches using Monte Carlo as a Poisson process, combining the goals scored and conceded by each team, weighted by the Elo ratio.
